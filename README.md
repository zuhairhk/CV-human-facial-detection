# Facial Emotion Detection

## Overview
This project detects **human emotions** from facial expressions using a **hybrid Computer Vision + Machine Learning** approach.  
We use **OpenCV** and **dlib** for facial feature detection, and extracted geometric features are later classified using traditional ML models.
